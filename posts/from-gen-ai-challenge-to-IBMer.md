## Introduction

It's been a while since I've written here, and I have some exciting news to share about my professional journey.

Let me start with what has become a classic LinkedIn announcement:

> **I'm thrilled to announce that I have joined IBM India Software Labs as a Software Developer Intern! üöÄ**

Yes, I've begun my journey as a software developer intern at IBM India Software Labs, Kochi, on January 27, 2025. What makes this story special is how I secured this position despite my college not being on IBM's regular hiring pool list.

## The WatsonX GenAI Challenge

The story begins in May 2024, when IBM announced the WatsonX GenAI Challenge for startups and students. This competition served as a pre-event to India's first International GenAI Conclave, scheduled for July 2024.

Like many colleges in Kerala, we received the announcement through our college mailing list and WhatsApp forwards. As final-year students eager to showcase our skills, my classmates and I were immediately intrigued. While I had previously participated in various online hackathons and challenges hosted by communities like Tinkerhub, this opportunity felt different.

We formed a team comprising my friends Joel, Adwaith, Robin, and myself, with our faculty member Anil sir serving as our Single Point of Contact (SPoC). After completing the registration process, we were ready to face the real competition.

### Round 1: The Virtual Challenge

The first round was conducted entirely online. We had to choose between developing a WatsonX assistant (Chatbot) or working with WatsonX AI. We opted for WatsonX.ai, believing it would offer more flexibility in building solutions using IBM's AI models and tools.

The primary task was to submit a project pitch, but with our packed schedule of internal and university exams, we nearly missed the deadline. In a last-minute sprint the night before the 7 AM deadline, we crafted our proposal using AI tools to help streamline the process.

### Our Innovation: SoulSync - The AI Companion

We proposed developing an AI Companion designed to enhance memory, cognitive function, and emotional well-being in elderly individuals through personalized storytelling and reminders. We called the innovation "SoulSync". The system would allow family members to input memories they wanted to share with their elderly relatives. Using sentiment analysis, the AI would adapt its responses based on the user's emotional state.

Our complete vision included integration with virtual assistants like Alexa and Google Home, along with smart home device connectivity. However, for the competition, we focused solely on the core storytelling component.

### Round 2: The Prototyping Challenge

The second round brought us to IBM's Kochi office for a two-day prototyping session. Only 10 teams out of the initial 100 made it to this stage. We faced several challenges:

1. My teammate Robin had suffered a shoulder fracture during exams and the doctors advised rest
2. Transportation to Infopark was complicated, requiring multiple public transit connections
3. The early 8:00 AM reporting time posed logistical challenges

Initially discouraged, we considered withdrawing. However, our SPOC, Anil sir, provided the motivation we needed to continue. The organizers accommodated Robin's condition by allowing him to attend only the second day, and we decided that even if we didn't win, the experience of working in IBM's actual office environment would be invaluable.

**Day 1:** Our first taste of a professional office environment was eye-opening. We explored various WatsonX tools and received temporary access to IBM Cloud services. Despite limited documentation for some tools, we developed a working JavaScript prototype for story generation based on pre-defined memories. We also used this opportunity to network with other participants, making valuable connections.

The day concluded with an insightful presentation workshop led by Sarika Nair, HR at IBM ISL Kochi.

**Day 2:** Presentation day brought its own challenges. When I connected my GNU/Linux laptop running KDE+i3 to the projector, we encountered display issues. This technical hiccup actually worked in our favor, giving us an unexpected 5-minute buffer to compose ourselves while the panelists took a coffee break.

Our 15-minute presentation was a well-coordinated team effort:
- Robin explained the project background
- I handled the technical demonstration
- Adwaith discussed the AI accessibility aspects
- Joel presented the system architecture

We fielded the panel's questions confidently and left feeling proud of our performance.

## International GenAI Conclave

On July 4th, we received the incredible news: we were among the winners! The competition that had started with 100 teams and narrowed to 10 finalists had recognized our innovation.

We returned to IBM's office on July 9th to refine our product:
- Joel developed the backend using Spring Boot
- Adwaith and I designed the frontend for user information and memory collection
- Robin prepared the final pitch deck

We were honored to receive an invitation to India's first International GenAI Conclave at the prestigious Grand Hyatt, Kochi. The event, held on July 11th and 12th, was a landmark occasion inaugurated by Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. While I couldn't attend in person due to a prior commitment at the Google India office at Bengaluru for my GDSC Graduation event, I contributed remotely and watched the livestream.

Our team secured the first runner-up position, earning recognition in local media and even a congratulatory post from our university.

## Becoming an IBMer

The competition opened an unexpected door to IBM employment. On August 29th, we received an email about IBM ISL 2025 hiring opportunities for challenge participants. After submitting our applications, we interviewed remotely on September 9th.

The 45-minute interview included technical and HR questions, and despite the pressure of concurrent series exams, we maintained our composure. On September 18th, we received offers for a 6-month internship followed by full-time positions. Though bittersweet that only two of us were selected, we were grateful for the opportunity.

After completing the onboarding process, I officially joined IBM ISL Kochi on January 27th, receiving my ID card and my workstation.
